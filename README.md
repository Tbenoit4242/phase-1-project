# Drink Recipes Single Page Application

## Project Overview

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to search for drink recipes, view details of specific drinks, and keep track of previously viewed drinks. The application fetches data from the [TheCocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to provide users with a variety of drink recipes. This project demonstrates the integration of frontend technologies with a third-party API to create a dynamic and interactive web application.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for drinks by entering a keyword. The application fetches matching drink recipes from the API and displays them.
- **View Drink Details:** Clicking on a drink card displays detailed information about the drink, including its category, glass type, instructions, and ingredients.
- **Previously Viewed Drinks:** The application keeps track of previously viewed drinks and displays them in a separate section. Users can clear the history of viewed drinks.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the basic structure of the application.
- **CSS:** For styling the application, including the layout, colors, and fonts.
- **JavaScript:** For fetching data from the API, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating the DOM.
- **TheCocktailDB API:** A free API used to fetch drink recipes.
